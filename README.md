#ESP32 Control Project This project provides a web interface for controlling an ESP32 device, specifically for managing a fan and cleaning/dust functions. Overview The ESP32 Control Project consists of a simple web interface that allows users to control various functions of an ESP32 device. The current implementation includes controls for:

##Fan operation Cleaning/Dust function A slider for adjustable control (e.g., speed or intensity)

##Features Simple, clean user interface Fan control button Cleaning/Dust control button Adjustable slider for variable control Responsive design for various screen sizes

#Setup ##Hardware Requirements ESP32 development board Fan and cleaning mechanism Power supply for ESP32 and connected components

##Software Requirements Web browser ESP32 Arduino core Web server running on ESP32

##Installation Clone this repository to your local machine. Open the index.html file in a web browser to view the interface. Modify the ESP32 code (not included in this repo) to handle HTTP requests from the web interface. Upload the modified ESP32 code to your device.

##Usage Ensure your ESP32 is powered on and connected to your local network. Open a web browser and navigate to the ESP32â€™s IP address (e.g., http://192.168.4.1). Use the buttons to control the fan and cleaning/dust functions. Adjust the slider for variable control (functionality depends on your ESP32 implementation).

##Customization You can customize the interface by modifying the index.html file.
